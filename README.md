# GRAPHICS_ON_VIRTUALTFT
This is a possible summary of the code:

The code is a Python program that uses tkinter to create a virtual TFT display. The code does the following:

It defines some constants and variables, such as the TFT width, height, and colors.
It creates a class called VirtualTFT that takes a master parameter and initializes a canvas object with the TFT dimensions and background color.
It defines some methods for the VirtualTFT class, such as:
update_clock: This method displays the current time on the bottom of the canvas using a green font.
draw_circles: This method draws 35 random circles on the canvas with random colors, positions, and radii.
draw_squares: This method draws a square with reducing side lengths and rainbow background on the canvas.
draw_triangles: This method draws 35 random triangles on the canvas with random colors, positions, and sizes.
draw_rainbow_background: This method draws a rainbow background on the canvas by using colorsys to convert hue values to RGB colors.
It creates an instance of the VirtualTFT class and calls its methods to draw the shapes and the clock on the canvas.
It prints a message in magenta color on the center of the canvas that says “Code by Arvind 4/12/23”.
